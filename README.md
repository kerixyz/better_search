# Better Search

The goal of this project is to:
- Explore various ways to provide streamer recommendations
- Combine multiple recommendation approaches

# Measurements for Similarity

In order to compare streamers, we need to quantify metrics or characteristics that can be compared between them. This could be games that they play, 

## Streamers in a Similar Genre

#### Assumption

Twitch viewers are likely to watch streams that revolve around the same genre that they prefer watching. People who enjoy passively listening to streams may enjoy streams that are tagged as "Just Chatting". Another group of people might enjoy watching streamers who are playing the recently released "Helldivers 2" game.

#### Data Needed

- Streamer Name
- Stream Category


## Streamers in a Similar Group

#### Assumption

Twitch viewers are likely to watch streams that other viewers also like to engage with.

#### Data Needed 

- Streamer Name
- Unique chatter names in streams

For this data, it might be good to gather the chatters from 3 streams to see who are frequent chatters.

## Streamers Who Stream The Same Things

#### Assumption

Genres can be one time screenshots of what a streamer shows. However, someone might be interested ingames 


# Measurements for Filtering

Simply relying on genres and cliques can lead to simply choosing from a small pool of highly successful streamers. As a viewer, this limits who I can watch. As an up and coming streamer, this increases the barrier for me to be successful.

## Find Streamers that Stream at Certain Times

## Filter Streamers to Ones that Stream like My Streamer
